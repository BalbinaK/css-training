##My first training with CSS

This repository stores files prepared by **The Net Ninja** who let me take a first glimpse at CSS in action. 

Basing on his [CSS Tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZy528TnkBE&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT&index=52) I was able to practice the use of CSS on a simple example of a basic but neat bike shop website.
